# Hangman Game
Hangman Game is exactly what the title infers. It is a simple hangman game that was built using the Android SDK and runs on Android. The app pulls a list of words from Oxford Dictionary using a RESTful API. From there it stores completed words, and uncompleted words in local SQLite database along with user's score. The scores are also sent to a remote server residing on AWS so that player's scores can be viewed across devices.
